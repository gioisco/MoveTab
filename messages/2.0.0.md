# v2.0.0 (2024-03-10)

- Breaking: Moving tabs relatively does not cycle by default anymore.
  Add the parameter `"cycle": true` to your key bindings
  to restore the old behavior.
- Added a command palette entry to edit key bindings.
  You can find it as *Preferences: MoveTab Key Bindings*.
- Added support for negative integers
  to move to a position relative from the end of the group.
